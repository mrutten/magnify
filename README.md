# Magnify

## Getting started

Magnify is a lightweight screen magnifier that runs on Void Linux with i3WM, 
so on a minimal X11 system with an X server that doesn’t coalesce motion events 
aggressively.

## Installation

Compile the binary by running `make`, then run `bin/magnify` or copy the binary 
to a directory in PATH.

Run `make help` to get help on the make options.
Clang utils and Valgrind may have to be installed for all options to work.

## Usage

Run the binary and move the mouse over the region to magnify, or use hjkl keys 
to move around. Press q to quit the application.
